| Architecture contract bootstrap | Python standard-library JSON parser over the JSON subset of YAML 1.2                         | Hand-written YAML parser; mandatory platform service | Repo-local dependency-free structural gate; richer maintained tools remain repo-specific.    |
| Import/dependency rules         | Existing repo lint/import tools where configured; declarative YAML boundary is authoritative | Custom import framework                              | Keep custom AST checks narrow; use maintained Import Linter/Tach/Ruff/deptry when warranted. |
| AI interaction                  | AGENTS + deterministic CLI/contracts + capability discovery + skills                         | MCP/plugin in every repo                             | Escalate only after measured interoperability/lifecycle need.                                |

### Two-user design

- AI: AGENTS + deterministic frontend/backend commands and capability notes; no MCP/plugin by default.
- Human/notebook: Typed app/service APIs; notebook use only for isolated analytics services; no clever dunders.
- Planned Python protocols: Python dunders apply only to FastAPI support code; the static web path uses language-native TypeScript contracts.
- Core posture: Consume prebuilt ui_and_artifacts outputs; no PDP/FPF internals.
- Data posture: Static-first public content adapter with curated/redacted React-folio resume JSON; optional API adapters remain separate from presentation and must record source/freshness/evidence before use.
- Consolidation evidence: `docs/REACT_FOLIO_CONSOLIDATION.md` records the one-way React-folio to main_website migration, phone redaction, static export posture, and explicit source-repository retention.

### Extension and exception discipline

Probable extensions must cross named ports/capability registries rather than adding sibling modules indefinitely. Every exception is exact, risk-bearing, no-growth, and has a refactoring trigger. Generated/vendor/migration/resource paths are declared explicitly; they do not silently weaken runtime rules.
