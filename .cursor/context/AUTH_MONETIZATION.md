# AUTH & MONETIZATION (Minimal‑Friction First)

## Authentication
- MVP WITHOUT auth unless required.  
- If needed, for Next.js use **Auth.js (NextAuth)** with email or GitHub/Google OAuth; keep it server‑side.  
- For FastAPI‑only areas later, use JWT (short‑lived) and refresh tokens.

## Monetization (do not block MVP)
- Start with **donation link**: Buy Me a Coffee or GitHub Sponsors (fastest, no app changes).  
- If/when traffic/interest grows, introduce **Stripe Checkout** for paid content/demos.  
- Note: Vercel’s **Hobby** plan is for non‑commercial use; upgrade to Pro or host elsewhere when monetizing.

## Placement & UX
- Add a single, unobtrusive “Support” button in Footer and About page.  
- Avoid ads. Keep primary goal: credibility for job hunting.
