offers  a  superior  developer  experience  for  a  coder  and  room  to  grow  with  interactive  and  intelligent
Chosen Architecture: Next.js Frontend with FastAPI Backend
Overview:  The website will be structured as a React/Next.js frontend  (deployed, for example, on Vercel for
ease of hosting) that communicates with a  FastAPI backend  (deployed on a cloud platform as an API
service). This decoupled, ‚Äúfrontend-backend‚Äù architecture is common in modern web apps and aligns well
with  our  needs .  The  Next.js  app  will  handle  all  UI/UX,  routing  for  pages,  and  static  content
generation, while the FastAPI service will handle any dynamic data: project data (if we store projects in a
database or even a JSON), contact form submissions, and AI model endpoints.
System architecture diagram:  The flow of requests in the deployed application will look like this:
[    Browser    ]  --requests-->  [ Next.js Frontend (Vercel) ]
                                      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ API calls --> [ FastAPI Backend ] --> 
[Database or ML models]
In this setup, a user‚Äôs browser requests pages from the Next.js application. Next can serve pre-built pages
for example, the list of projects to display, or the answer to an AI query ‚Äì it will fetch from the FastAPI
backend via HTTP calls. The FastAPI backend, being in Python, can easily retrieve data from a database

AI demo becomes popular (CPU heavy on the backend), we can scale up the FastAPI service (more instances
or move to a server with GPU), without affecting the frontend. Meanwhile, the Next.js frontend (especially if
mostly static pages) can handle many users via CDN. This kind of architecture is used in many SaaS and AI
apps for performance and modularity . - Development efficiency:  Crist√≥bal can work in Python on the
(ChatGPT) can mitigate any lack of deep JS expertise by helping with React/Next code as needed. - Security:
By having a dedicated backend, we can keep secrets (API keys for OpenAI, email credentials, etc.) out of the
frontend. Next.js does allow secure environment variables and server-only code, but if we prefer Python
tools (for example, a Python email library or an OpenAI Python SDK), the backend is the right place. The
backend can also implement authentication and other protections for future premium content. - Example
in industry:  This Next.js + FastAPI pattern is gaining popularity. In fact, Vercel (the company behind Next.js)
provides an official starter template for an AI chatbot with Next.js as UI and FastAPI as the streaming

projects already present (good for SEO). The React hydration then takes over for any interactive bits (say, a

good choice for a professional yet custom design; the Vinta template even includes shadcn/UI + Tailwind for
polished components .) We will use either Next‚Äôs classic pages directory or the newer App Router
(Next 13+). The App Router with React Server Components could be beneficial for streaming data from the
splitting, and a familiar React development experience. - FastAPI (Python 3)  will expose RESTful endpoints.
Key dependencies likely include Pydantic  (for defining data models like Project or ContactForm schemas),
and possibly fastapi-mail  for sending emails or fastapi-users  if we add authentication later . If we proceed
with user auth (for future premium content), a library like fastapi-users can provide JWT auth routes easily

Frontend Structure: Pages and Components in Next.js
Using Next.js, we will organize the front-end code into reusable components and pages to keep the project
maintainable. Next.js encourages a modular structure, where each page can import common layout or UI
components. Here‚Äôs how we plan to break it down:
Layout Components:  We will create a common layout (e.g., a MainLayout  component or use Next
Page Components:  Each page (Home, About, Projects, Contact, etc.) will be a component (or a Next
page in the pages folder). These page components focus on arranging the content of that page,
using smaller components. For example:
preview of 2-3 projects. Those could be composed by using the ProjectCard component (described
below) or a specialized ‚ÄúFeaturedProjects‚Äù component that internally uses ProjectCard . It will

managing state (like the conversation history) and calling backend endpoints. We might use an
existing React chat UI component for the chatbot.
Reusable UI Components:  We‚Äôll create components for pieces of UI that appear in multiple places
elsewhere, like a call-to-action on Home ‚ÄúContact me‚Äù). This component handles its own state and
calls the POST /api/contact  endpoint.
State Management:  Next.js (React) will handle local state within components (using hooks like

Styling:  We will choose between CSS frameworks. Two strong options: Tailwind CSS  (utility-first CSS

Material-UI  for ready-made components. Tailwind is popular , lightweight, and ensures a cohesive
design if used with care (the Vinta template uses Tailwind, indicating it fits well with Next/FastAPI

On the backend, FastAPI will be organized into a few routers or modules corresponding to site functionality:

return the full detail for one project. Initially, this data might just be a hard-coded list or loaded from
a JSON file. If we later connect a database, we‚Äôd have a Project model and query it. FastAPI makes it
trivial to serve JSON; using Pydantic models we can ensure the data is well-structured and
Contact API:  A POST /contact  endpoint to handle form submissions. This will accept a payload

Leveraging Python libraries:  - For the AI features,  LangChain  will be considered. LangChain can help

like a resume Q&A or a chatbot that‚Äôs confined to a certain knowledge base. - For database interactions (if

Pydantic  settings  for  email  configuration.  Alternatively,  since  this  is  small  scale,  we  might  simply  use

Security  &  Authentication:  While  the  MVP  doesn‚Äôt  require  user  login  (it‚Äôs  an  open  portfolio),  future
monetization might involve gating content for registered users. We plan ahead by possibly using JWT auth
in  FastAPI.  The  Vinta  template  includes  FastAPI  Users  which  provides  a  ready-made  user  model,
registration, login, etc., and Next.js can either use those via API or we set up NextAuth on the frontend with

we might implement a basic HTTP auth or admin secret for any admin-only endpoints (like an endpoint to

5. Performance for monetization:  If the site grows (in content or users), we have chosen a stack that can
scale. Next.js can handle high traffic with static pages and caching. FastAPI can scale behind an ASGI server

## Summary from Development Plan for a Next.js + FastAPI Personal Portfolio Website
Development Plan for a Next.js + FastAPI Personal
Contact  pages, with a clean design to impress recruiters. We choose  Next.js  (React framework) for a
modern,  responsive  frontend  and  FastAPI  (Python)  for  a  powerful  backend,  balancing  a  great  user
experience with Python-friendly data and AI integrations . This stack is forward-looking ‚Äì ready for
future interactive AI demos and even monetization (like paid content) later on . The primary goals
Maintainability:  Use modern tools and best practices (modular code, testing, CI/CD) so the site is
Note:  Early monetization (e.g. a newsletter or paid content) is not in scope for the MVP. Those
Tech Stack and Architecture
Frontend ‚Äì Next.js:  We will use Next.js (React framework) for the frontend. Next.js enables fast, SEO-
for impressing recruiters . Although Next.js uses TypeScript/JavaScript, which means Crist√≥bal will
work outside Python for the UI, it‚Äôs worthwhile for the dynamic and polished UI it provides. The decoupled
frontend also means we can keep heavy ML logic in the Python backend and just call it via API .
Backend ‚Äì FastAPI:  FastAPI (Python) will serve as the backend, exposing RESTful API endpoints for dynamic
content (e.g. project data, contact form submissions, future AI model queries). FastAPI is chosen because
it‚Äôs high-performance and very Pythonic, allowing Crist√≥bal to leverage his Python and ML experience on
the server side . We‚Äôll define data models with Pydantic (for input/output validation) and can easily
integrate ML libraries or a database when needed . The backend will remain lightweight for MVP ‚Äì12
System  Architecture:  The  site  will  follow  a  standard  decoupled  architecture:  the  Next.js  frontend
(deployed on Vercel) serves the pages and static assets, and it communicates via HTTP with the  FastAPI
backend  (deployed as a cloud API service) for any dynamic data or actions . 
When a user visits a page, Next.js will serve pre-rendered HTML (for fast load and SEO) and then
hydrate into a React app . 
If that page needs data (e.g. the Projects page), Next.js can fetch it from FastAPI either at build-time
or on-demand. For example, we might do a static generation that calls a /api/projects  endpoint
For interactive features like the Contact form or future AI demos, the Next.js app will make client-
side requests to FastAPI. For instance, submitting the Contact form triggers a POST request to a
FastAPI /api/contact  route, which sends an email or records the message, then FastAPI returns
a success status that Next.js uses to display a ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù message . Similarly, an AI Q&A
page could call a /api/ask  endpoint on FastAPI, which runs an ML model (possibly via LangChain)
and streams back an answer . Next.js would stream and render the answer in real-time.
This architecture is highly maintainable and scalable . The frontend and backend are independent services
we could upgrade the FastAPI server (or add GPU instances) without touching the front end. Meanwhile, the
mostly-static Next.js front end can handle traffic via Vercel‚Äôs CDN easily . Security is also improved:
sensitive secrets (email credentials, API keys) reside only on the backend, not in front-end code .
Visualizing the Flow:  When a user‚Äôs  Browser  requests a page from  Next.js (Vercel) , Next
data, the Next app makes an  API call  to  FastAPI , which might query a  database or ML
model , then returns JSON data that Next.js uses to update the UI . This is illustrated in
Diagram: Browser -> Next.js Frontend -> (API call) -> FastAPI Backend -> Database/ML
UI Framework & Design System:  We will use  Tailwind CSS  for styling the React components, possibly
paired with a component library like shadcn/UI  for pre-built, accessible components. Tailwind is a utility-
In fact, an established Next.js+FastAPI template uses Tailwind and shadcn/UI, indicating this is a well-
supported approach . We could alternatively consider Chakra UI  (for ready-made React components
with built-in styling) or Material UI , but Tailwind+shadcn strikes a good balance between ease of use  (pre-
styled components) and flexibility  (we can easily tweak or add custom styles) . For now, we‚Äôll plan to
start with Tailwind CSS to style our pages and maybe introduce shadcn/UI if we need more complex
components quickly (like modals or menus). This ensures a cohesive design that is mobile-responsive out of
Data and State:  In the MVP, we can manage without a complex database. Project details might be stored in
a simple JSON or YAML file or even hardcoded as an array in the code for now. FastAPI can just read this and

submit it will call a FastAPI endpoint to send the message (for now, perhaps as an email to Crist√≥bal)
the form will be simple (no login needed to submit). The FastAPI backend can use an email library or
a service API to forward these messages.
And Premium Content  would be a members-only area if monetization (courses, etc.) comes into play later
. Planning our architecture now to accommodate these means we won‚Äôt have to refactor navigation or
user auth from scratch when the time comes . For example, we might keep the NavBar component4546

JSON format. This might read from a file or have a hardcoded list of project data (later , we could plug

email, message) and sends an email. We can use a library like fastapi-mail  or simply integrate‚Ä¢ 
with an email API (SendGrid, etc.) configured via environment variables. Initially, if email is tricky, we

CORS Configuration:  Allow the Next.js frontend to call the FastAPI backend. If they‚Äôre on different
domains (e.g., Next on Vercel and FastAPI on Render), we need to enable CORS for Vercel‚Äôs domain.
We‚Äôll use FastAPI‚Äôs CORSMiddleware  for this, specifying the allowed origin as our front-end URL
Next.js Data Fetching:  Modify the Projects page to load real data. We can use Next.js‚Äôs data fetching
(on each request) to call our FastAPI /api/projects  and pass the data to the page as props.
Static generation is likely fine here (since projects don‚Äôt change often) . If using the Next.js

basic error handling ‚Äì for instance, if the FastAPI is down or returns an error , the frontend should

documenting functions (especially in FastAPI) is good practice. We can let Copilot draft docstrings for
our API endpoints (it often pulls parameter details into a nice format). We also update the README in
generating an outline for the README (installation steps, usage, deployment instructions).
Testing:  Aim to write basic tests for critical components. For the backend, we can use pytest to
write a couple of tests for the API (for example, using FastAPI‚Äôs test client to POST to
/api/contact  with sample data and asserting we get a 200 response). For the frontend, we might
use a tool like React Testing Library or Cypress to test that pages render and the contact form
sees function signatures. We will prompt it with comments like ‚Äú// Test that the projects API returns
project list‚Äù and often it can stub out a test function.
Performance Checks:  Ensure images are optimized (Next.js‚Äôs Image component helps here), and
party component is too heavy, consider code-splitting or removing it. Also, verify the Lighthouse
performance and accessibility scores (Next.js generally scores well out of the box). Minor tweaks like

7. Deployment (Week 4)
With everything tested locally, we move to deploy both the frontend and backend, using cloud platforms ‚Äì
ideally Vercel  for Next.js (as it‚Äôs the native host) and a suitable service for FastAPI. 
Deploy Next.js to Vercel:  We connect the GitHub repo to Vercel. Vercel will detect the Next.js project
and build/deploy it automatically on push. We‚Äôll configure the project settings on Vercel, including
environment variables (if any, e.g., we might have an API base URL or OpenAI key for the prototype ‚Äì
though the OpenAI key stays on FastAPI side). Vercel provides a globally distributed CDN for the
